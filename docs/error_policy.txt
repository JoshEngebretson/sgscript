- E: error
- W: warning

main policy guidelines:
- anything that prevents the script from executing code is an Error
- anything that has more chance of being unexpected than not is an Error
	-- for example, when given types/values don't support the intended operation
	-- not having properties may be expected so it's a warning - breaks while debugging, no issues otherwise
- the main exception is cascading failures
	-- should disable code paths not stop things while still being detectable
	-- null variables are key to this - most parsing functions don't accept them, they're returned on errors
